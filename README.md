# CSCHacks2021
Project Description

We want to create a rudimentary interactive game (possibly mobile) using Unreal Engine 4.

We want to do this because our team is interested in game development and we want to learn the various technologies and skills required to do so. We also want to learn what the process of publishing an app will is like. 

Doing this will require an understanding of the Unreal Engine program, coding languages such as C++, and possibly some knowledge of app development (probably IOS).

We anticipate that time constraints might limit what we can build since most of us will be learning all the details from scratch.
