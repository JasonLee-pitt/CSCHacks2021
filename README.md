# CSCHacks2021
Project Description

We want to create a rudimentary interactive game (possibly mobile) using Unreal Engine 4.

We want to do this because our team is interested in game development and we want to learn the various technologies and skills required to do so. We also want to learn what the process of publishing an app will is like. 

Doing this will require an understanding of the Unreal Engine program, coding languages such as C++, and possibly some knowledge of app development (probably IOS).

We anticipate that time constraints might limit what we can build since most of us will be learning all the details from scratch.

MVP Demo
-----------------

1. Click this link: https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/stl82_pitt_edu/Elz0gy9_X6lOi34kSO_rp8oBRZ95xlkWQyiuD3rlsRK9aA
2. Download the folder
3. Open the folder and attempt to run the application(You may need to install a runner to run it but if you try to run it it should tell you what you need)
4. Now this is a very early version of the game so for right now the mouse won't appear on the main menu screen. If you computer is touch screen then just push start otherwise click the windows icon on your keyboard to make the mouse appear then hit start
5. Space bar to jump and arrow keys to move back and forth
